# Arm_Robot_detection_by_Mask_RCNN





This repository is part of my master graduate design which uses Mask-RCNN to detect objects. If U want to use M-RCNN to your own project, this repository is a good choice, I will introduce all the steps to help to finish your work. 



1 	U should prepared your own data to train the network. The folder ''train_data" is my data, there are 4 important folder in it, include:

​		 (1)"pic" you should put all the train pictures in it; 

​		 (2)"json" in this folder, you should use an app called "labelme" to create json 	files base on your train data in  the "pic" folder. it's very easy to install.

 			pip install labelme
